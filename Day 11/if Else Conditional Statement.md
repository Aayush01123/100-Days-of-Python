# if-else Statements

<br>
Sometimes the programmer needs to check the evaluation of certain exppression(s), whether the expression(s) evaluate to True or False. If the expression evaluates to False, the the program execution follows a different path than if would have if the expression had evaluated to True.

Based on this, the conditional statements are further classified ito following types:

- if
- if-else
- if-else-elif
- nested if-else-elif

# An if....else statement evaluates like this:

## if the expression evaluates True:
Execute the block of code inside if statement. After execution return to the code out of the if.....else block.

## if the expression evaluates False:
Execute the block of code inside else statement. After execution return to the code out the if....else block.


## Example:

```
applePrice = 210
budget = 200
if (applePrice <= budget):
    print("Alexa, add 1 kg Apples to the cart.")
else:
    print("Alexa, do not add Apples to the cart.")
```
