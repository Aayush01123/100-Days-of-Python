# Day 7 - Taking User Input in Python

<br>
In Python, we can take user input directly by using input()function. This input function gives a return value as string/character hence we have to pass that into a variable.

## Syntax:

```
variable=input()
```

But input functions return the value as string. Hence we have to typecast them whenever required to another datatype.

## Example

<br>
```
variable=int(input())
variable=float(input())
```
We can also display a text using input function. This will make input()function take user input and display a message as well.

## Example:

```
a = input("Enter the name: ")
print(a)
```
