# Excerise 2: Good Morning Sir
<br>
Create a Python program capable of greeting you with Good Morning, Good Afternoon and Good Evening. Your program should use time module to get the current hour. Here is a sample program and documentation link for you:

```
import time

timestamp = time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
print(timestamp)
Hour = time.strftime("%H")
print (Hour)
min = time.strftime("%M")
print(min)
sec = time.strftime("%S")
print(sec)
```
